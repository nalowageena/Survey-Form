## Description

- This is the second challenge of the responsive web design course by freeCodeCamp and like the name implies, it involves making a form with just HTML and CSS.
- There are 16 user stories that must be implemented before submitting.

This is what my survey form looks like now:

## To Do List

- Finish with the last two user stories for the survey form challenge:
  - If I do not enter my name in the name field, I should see an HTML validation error.
  - if I do not enter my email in the email field, I should see an HTML validation error.
- Make the image in the form and the form as a whole responsive.
